### Assignment: tagger_cle_rnn
#### Date: Deadline: May 03, 23:59
#### Points: 2 points

This assignment is a continuation of `tagger_we`. Using the
`tagger_cle_rnn.py` template (to appear soon),
implement character-level word embedding computation using
a bidirectional character-level RNN.

Once submitted to ReCodEx, you should experiment with the effect of CLEs
compared to a plain `tagger_we`, and the influence of their dimensionality. Note
that `tagger_we` has by default word embeddings twice the size of word
embeddings in `tagger_cle_rnn`.

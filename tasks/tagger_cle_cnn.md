### Assignment: tagger_cle_cnn
#### Date: Deadline: May 03, 23:59
#### Points: 2 points

This task is a continuation of `tagger_cle_rnn` assignment. Using the
[tagger_cle_cnn.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/08/tagger_cle_cnn.py)
template, instead of using RNNs to generate character-level embeddings,
process character sequences with 1D convolutional filters with varying kernel
sizes and obtain fixed-size representations using global max-pooling.
Compute the final embeddings by using a highway layer.
